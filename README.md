![__results___3_0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79527973/212548655-adc310dc-6cf0-404d-b4c2-a36c2eb1fc56.png)
### What will we do in this project?
In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classifictaion model.We will be using tensorflow and keras for this project.

### Conclusion
We started with loading the dataset and visualizing the images. Normalizing is an important step when working with any type of dataset. After that we created a CNN Model which is further used for predicting the plant diseases using the image supplied to model. This model is highly beneficial as it can be used by different agricultural firms and farmers to increase their yield and stop wastage of crops due to disease.
